Proposal

Purpose:

In this project, We are trying to formalize a small part of a compiler, by which we mean that first

we define the syntax and semantics for each intermediate language and then while writing

each passing as typing-preserving functions between syntax of intermediate languages, we

give the correctness-proof as semantics-preserving functions between the semantics of

intermediate languages.

Progress:

Weâ€™ve finish a trivial closure conversion pass (by which I mean The closure conversion

algorithm would save every free variable), we are trying to upgrade this.

Meanwhile we are trying to give a formalization to the heap.
